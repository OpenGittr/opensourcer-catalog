    {
      "question": "How does n8n compare to Zapier?",
      "answer": "n8n offers similar functionality with 400+ integrations, but you can self-host it and run unlimited workflows without per-execution fees. It also supports custom code for advanced use cases."
    },
    {
      "question": "What are the resource requirements?",
      "answer": "A basic instance runs well on 1 vCPU and 2GB RAM (~$10/month). For heavy workflows, consider 2 vCPUs and 4GB RAM."

    {
      "question": "Can I migrate from Zapier?",
      "answer": "While there's no automatic migration, n8n supports most services Zapier does. You'll need to recreate workflows, but the visual editor makes this straightforward."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is it production-ready?",
      "answer": "Yes. n8n is used by companies like Adobe and is designed for production workloads. We configure it with proper backups, SSL, and monitoring."
